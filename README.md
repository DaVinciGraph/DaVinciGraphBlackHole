# DaVinciGraph Black Hole 🚀🌌

## Overview
DaVinciGraph Black Hole is a groundbreaking smart contract on the Hedera Hashgraph, designed to permanently remove fungible tokens from circulation, including those without an admin key. Traditionally, only tokens with an admin key can be burned, but with this smart contract, tokens without an admin key can also be effectively 'burned'.

## Quick Links 🌐
- **Interface:** [https://davincigraph.io/burns/tokens](https://davincigraph.io/burns/tokens)
- **Hashscan Link:** [https://hashscan.io/mainnet/contract/0.0.3158042](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/contract/0.0.3158042)

## Features ⭐
- **Token Burning:** The smart contract receives and locks away tokens, permanently removing them from circulation. This process effectively 'burns' the tokens.
- **All Tokens Are Eligible:** Unlike traditional methods, both tokens with and without admin keys can be burned via this contract.
- **Auto-Renewal:** The contract charges 3 HBAR and holds it for auto-renewal.
- **Security and Transparency:** Built on Hedera Hashgraph, all actions are secure, transparent, and automated.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Send Tokens:** Users send tokens to the smart contract address.
2. **Burn Tokens:** The smart contract receives and locks away the tokens forever, effectively 'burning' them.
3. **Verify Transaction:** All token actions are traceable and publicly verifiable on Hashscan: [https://hashscan.io/mainnet/contract/0.0.3158042](https://hashscan.io/mainnet/contract/0.0.3158042)
